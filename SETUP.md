### Configure Database
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`

3. For Google OAuth:
   - Enable Google provider
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials

### Configure Storage (Optional)
1. Go to Storage in Supabase dashboard
2. Create a bucket named "form-uploads"
3. Set up RLS policies for file access

## 2. Environment Variables

1. Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Fill in your Supabase credentials in `.env.local`:
```env
# Get these from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# App settings
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-string
```

### Where to Find Supabase Keys:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on Settings (gear icon) â†’ API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
4. For service role key, copy the service_role key (keep this secret!)

## 3. Install Dependencies & Run

The dependencies are already installed. To start the development server:
